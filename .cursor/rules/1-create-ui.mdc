# first: document your search process

    1. Search for all Components with HTML structure and props matched the Figma design exactly:

        - Search by feature name (e.g., "Emotion", "Modal", "Dialog")
        - Search by UI pattern (e.g., "Card", "TextField")
        - Search by business domain (e.g., "UserProfile", "ProductList")
        - Search by component name from Figma (e.g., "Card", "TextField")
        - Search by layout pattern (e.g., "Grid", "Flex", "Stack")
        - Search by component hierarchy (e.g., parent-child relationships)
        - Search by style properties (colors, typography, spacing)

    2. search locations in directories below for all similar Components and Identitfy the source codes of the components on only HTML code (in order ):

       - src/components/\* (common components)
       - src/pages/\* (page components)
       - src/layouts/\* (layout components)
       - src/templates/\* (template components)
       - src/hooks/\* (custom hooks)
       - src/utils/\* (utility components)
       - src/theme/* (theme configurations)
       - src/styles/* (shared styles)
       - src/constants/* (style constants)

    3. search all components wich have veryu similar structure on only HTML code even if it has a different content, analyze it for resuse or as a reference.

       - Analyze component nesting structure
       - Document component variants
       - Identify shared style properties
       - Map Figma constraints to CSS/styled-components

# Second: create a component matches the Figma design exactly.

    1. create codes following these guidelines and search result:

       - Prioritize using custom MUI components from src/components over original MUI components
       - show the relevant code and reuse exising components.
       - verify the 90% similarity on only HTML code first. if so, use and import it itself.
       - Make sure about resuability.
       - Follow project patterns.
       - Avoid code duplication.
       - Use proper path aliases.
       - Follow consistent component structure.
       - Consider UDL(Universal Design for Learning)
